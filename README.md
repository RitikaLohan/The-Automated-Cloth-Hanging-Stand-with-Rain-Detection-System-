**The-Automated-Cloth-Hanging-Stand-with-Rain-Detection-System-**
The Automated Cloth Hanging Stand with Rain Detection System uses rain and humidity sensors with a motorized mechanism to protect clothes from unexpected rain. It detects rainfall in real time and automatically retracts clothes under cover, ensuring convenience, efficiency, weather protection, and reducing manual effort in daily life.
## Automated Cloth Hanging Stand with Rain Detection System

The **Automated Cloth Hanging Stand with Rain Detection System** is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to protect clothes from unexpected rainfall while ensuring convenience and efficiency for daily household chores. Traditional cloth drying methods rely heavily on manual intervention, which can be inconvenient—especially during unpredictable weather conditions. This project aims to solve that problem using **smart sensors, automation, and simple mechanical design**.

### **Overview**

The system integrates **rain detection sensors**, **humidity sensors**, and **motorized mechanisms** to automatically move clothes under shelter when rain is detected. Using a combination of **water detection** and **environmental monitoring**, it ensures accurate and timely responses to changing weather conditions.

**Patent Status:** This project is **patented** and **published** under **Application No.: 202411003795.**

### **Key Components**

- **Rain Sensor** – Detects water droplets and triggers the retraction mechanism.  
- **Humidity Sensor** – Monitors moisture levels to confirm rainfall and reduce false triggers.  
- **Motorized Sliding/Retracting Mechanism** – Automatically shifts the hanging rod under cover.  
- **Control Unit (Microcontroller)** – Processes sensor inputs and activates the motor.  
- **Manual Override** – Allows the user to control the stand manually if needed.  

### **Working Principle**

1. **Detection** – Rain and humidity sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions.  
2. **Processing** – The control unit verifies sensor data to confirm rainfall.  
3. **Action** – Upon detection, the motorized stand retracts clothes under the roof or covered area.  
4. **Reset** – Once the rain stops and conditions return to normal, the system can extend the stand again.  

### **Features**

- Fully **automated rain detection** with real-time response.  
- **Energy-efficient** motor operation.  
- **Weather-resistant** design for outdoor use.  
- Simple and cost-effective construction.  
- Reduces the need for manual intervention.  

### **Applications**

- Residential households.  
- Apartment balconies.  
- Community laundry areas.  

### **Benefits**

This project saves time, prevents clothes from getting wet during sudden rain, and adds a layer of automation to everyday life. It demonstrates the practical application of **IoT, sensors, and automation** in home improvement, making it a valuable project for students, hobbyists, and innovators.

With its **patented** and **published** status **(Application No.: 202411003795)**, this project stands as a **unique, innovative,** and **legally recognized solution** in the field of **home automation.**
